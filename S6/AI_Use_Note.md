# GenAI Use Note

- Assisted in drafting measurable NFRs and acceptance criteria for edge cases.
- Prompts used (paraphrased):
    - "Generate measurable performance NFRs for a kiosk dashboard with real-time alerts."
    - "Write acceptance criteria including edge cases for temperature spike handling."
- What was accepted/edited:
    - Accepted AC suggestions, edited timing values to match our system (offline threshold 60s, spike <2 min).
    - NFRs were reviewed to ensure verification methods align with our test plan.
- No sensitive stakeholder data was included in prompts.
