## 2025-12-05 — S11 MiniTestPlan & SampleCases Planning

**Context:** Planning Mini Test Plan (MiniTestPlan.md) and Sample Test Cases (SampleCases.md) for anchor stories S1 (Offline sensor staleness) and S2 (Alerts toggle).

**Prompt summary:** Asked AI to suggest a structured layout for MiniTestPlan and SampleCases, including sections for scope, test levels, environments, entry/exit criteria, risks, and mapping to story ACs. Also asked for example equivalence classes (ECP) and boundary values (BVA) for key inputs.

**Kept:**  
- Overall structure and headings (Scope, Test Levels & Targets, Entry/Exit Criteria, Risks, To Dedicated Testing Course).  
- Mapping of S1/S2 to unit, integration, system, and UAT levels.  
- Example risks and deferred testing items.  

**Rejected:**  
- Any example test case IDs or payloads that didn’t match our story IDs.  
- Generic or placeholder descriptions that were not relevant to our product context.  

**Verification:**  
- Confirmed all kept suggestions align with our stories and ACs.  
- Checked that risks, test levels, and deferred items reflect realistic project scope.  
- Ensured no AI-generated secrets, sensitive data, or unverified results were included.
